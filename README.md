Written without use of any IDE. Tested on Apache Tomcat 8. Annotations are used, thus there is no web.xml descriptor.
War archive is in 'deploy' folder.

P.S. This is my first webapp so don't judge strictly. I know, code is awful, and I leave it here to keep in mind how I shouldn't write anymore :)
